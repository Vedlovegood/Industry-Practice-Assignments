        Why would a Roman Emperor ruling over millions spend his nights writing private notes to himself
        about humility,self control and death?. These werent speeches or public letters they werent meant
        for anyone else, just for him alone with his thoughts. 2000 years later his words still echo on 
        motivation quotes, in thearpy sessions and on bookshelves. The person was no other than Marcus
        Aurelius and the notes he wrote to himself were called as Meditations.
