    <h2>Great Fairy Fountain:</h2>

    <audio src="music.mp3" autoplay loop controls>
    </audio>

    <p>
        The autoplay attribute allows the audio to start playing automatically as soon 
        as the webpage loads, without the user having to click the play button. However, 
        many modern browsers restrict autoplay unless the audio is muted or the user has 
        interacted with the site before. This is done to avoid unexpected or unwanted 
        sounds from playing automatically.
